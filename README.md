# AI Systems From Scratch

## Overview
This repository is a structured body of work focused on understanding artificial intelligence systems by building and analyzing them from first principles.

Rather than relying on pre-built abstractions, the projects here emphasize direct implementation, controlled experimentation, and written technical reasoning.
The intent is to develop a concrete understanding of how learning systems behave—especially under failure, instability, and constraint.
This repository reflects a deliberate shift from using models to studying them.

## Scope

Work in this repository may span areas such as:

-Artificial intelligence and machine learning
-Data-driven modeling and analysis
-Optimization and system dynamics
-Computational methods and algorithmic behavior

The unifying theme is reasoning through construction: implementing core ideas directly and studying how systems behave in practice.

## Projects

### Mini-Project 1: Learning Rate Stability in Gradient-Based Learning
- Implemented linear regression from scratch using NumPy
- Studied convergence, divergence, and recovery through controlled learning-rate experiments
- Included loss visualizations and written technical observations

(As the repository evolves, projects may expand in scope and abstraction while maintaining the same emphasis on clarity and first-principles reasoning..)

## Philosophy
- From-scratch implementation over abstraction
- Experiments over theory-only learning
- Failure as a diagnostic tool
- Clear written reasoning alongside code

## Future Direction

Future projects may:

-Explore new domains
-increase system complexity
-integrate multiple concepts into larger artifacts
-shift focus as understanding deepens
